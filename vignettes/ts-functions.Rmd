It is staightforward to turn existing functions into functions that can deal
with any ts-boxable object.

The `ts_` function is a constructor function for tsbox time series functions. It
can be used to wrap any function that works with time series. The default is set
to R base `"ts"` class, so wrapping functions for `"ts"` time series (or vectors
or matrices) is as simple as:

```r
ts_(diff)(AirPassengers)
ts_(rowSums)(ts_c(mdeaths, fdeaths))
```

Note that `ts_` returns a function, which can be used without a name, as in the
examples above, or with a name, as in the following, sligthly more complex
example, which uses a post processing function:

```r
ts_prcomp <- ts_(function(x) predict(prcomp(x, scale = TRUE)))
ts_prcomp(ts_c(mdeaths, fdeaths))
```

It is easy to make functions from external packages ts-boxable, by wrapping them
into `ts_`.

```r
ts_dygraphs <- ts_(dygraphs::dygraph, class = "xts")
ts_forecast <- ts_(function(x) forecast::forecast(x)$mean, vectorize = TRUE)
ts_seas <- ts_(function(x) seasonal::final(seasonal::seas(x)), vectorize = TRUE)

ts_dygraphs(ts_c(mdeaths, EuStockMarkets))
ts_forecast(ts_c(mdeaths, fdeaths))
ts_seas(ts_c(mdeaths, fdeaths))
```

If you are explicit about the namespace (e.g., `dygraphs::dygraph`), 
`ts_` recognized the package in use and delives a meaningful message if the 
package is not installed.

Note that the `ts_` function deals with the conversion stuff, 'vectorizes' the
function so that it can be used with multiple time series.
