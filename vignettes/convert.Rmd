tsbox relies on a set of converters to convert time series stored as `ts`,
`xts`, `data.frame`, `data.table` or `tibble` to each other. This vignette
describes some background on two particular challenges, the conversion of
*equispaced points in time* to *actual dates or times*, and the *regularization 
of irregular time sequences*.

The classic way of storing time series in R are `"ts"` objects. These are simple
vectors with an attribute that describes the beginning of the series, the
(redundant) end, and the frequency. Thus, a monthly series, e.g.,
`AirPassengers` is defined as a numeric vector that starts at 1949, with
frequency 1. Thus, months are thought of as equispaced periods of exactly 1/12.

For most time series, this is not what is meant. The second period of
`AirPassengers`, February 1949, is of course shorter than the first one. tsbox
tries to acknowledge the fact by using **heuristic**, rather than **exact** time
conversion if possible.


## Heuristic time conversion

Whenever possible, tsbox relies on **heuristic time conversion**. When a
monthly `"ts"` time series, e.g., `AirPassengers`, is converted to a data
frame, each time stamp (of class `"Date"`) is the first day of the month. In
most circumstances, this reflects the actual meaning of the data stored in a
`"ts"` object. Technically, of course, this is not correct: `"ts"` objects
divide time in period of equal length, while in reality, February is shorter
than January. Heuristic conversion is done for the following frequencies:


| `ts`-frequency | time difference |
|----------------|-----------------|
|       365.2425 | 1 day           |
|             12 | 1 month         |
|              6 | 2 month         |
|              4 | 3 month         |
|              3 | 4 month         |
|              2 | 6 month         |
|              1 | 1 year          |
|            0.5 | 2 year          |
|          0.333 | 3 year          |
|           0.25 | 4 year          |
|            0.2 | 5 year          |
|            0.1 | 10 year         |

For example, converting `AirPassengers` to a data frame gives:

```r
head(ts_df(AirPassengers))
#>         time value
#> 1 1949-01-01   112
#> 2 1949-02-01   118
#> 3 1949-03-01   132
#> 4 1949-04-01   129
#> 5 1949-05-01   121
#> 6 1949-06-01   135
```
Heuristic conversion is reversible, so we can get back to the original object:

```r
all.equal(ts_ts(ts_df(AirPassengers)), AirPassengers)
#> [1] TRUE
```

## Exact time conversion

For all other frequencies, e.g. 260, of `EuStockMarkets`, tsbox uses  **exact
time conversion**. The year is divided into 260 equispaced units, and time
stamp of a period will be a point in time (of class `"POSIXct"`).

```r
head(ts_df(EuStockMarkets))
#>    id                time   value
#> 1 DAX 1991-07-01 03:18:27 1628.75
#> 2 DAX 1991-07-02 13:01:32 1613.63
#> 3 DAX 1991-07-03 22:44:38 1606.51
#> 4 DAX 1991-07-05 08:27:43 1621.04
#> 5 DAX 1991-07-06 18:10:48 1618.16
#> 6 DAX 1991-07-08 03:53:53 1610.61
```

Higher frequencies, like days, hours, minutes or seconds are generally equispaced, and exact time conversion is used.

Exact time conversion is generally reversible as well:

```r
all.equal(ts_ts(ts_df(EuStockMarkets)), EuStockMarkets)
#> [1] TRUE
```

However, for very high frequencies, rounding errors may lead to small
differences when going from data frame to `"ts"` and back. Conversion does not work reliably if the frequency is above one second. For these ultra high frequencies, tsbox is not tested and may not work as expected.

## Regularization of predefined frequencies

In data frames or `"xts"` objects, missing values are generally omitted. These
omitted `NA` values are called implicit missing values, as opposite to explicit
values. The function `ts_regular` allows us to *regularize* a series, by making
implicit `NA` values explicit. 

When regularizing, `ts_regular` analyzes the differences in the time stamp for
known frequencies. If it detects any, it builds a regular sequence based on the
highest detected frequency, and tries to match the time stamps to the regular
series. The result is a data frame or `"xts"` object with explicit `NA` values.
Regularization is automatically done when an object is converted to a `"ts"`
object.

For example, the following time series contains an implicit `NA` value in February 1974:

```r
df <- ts_df(fdeaths)[-2,]
head(df)
#>         time value
#> 1 1974-01-01   901
#> 3 1974-03-01   827
#> 4 1974-04-01   677
#> 5 1974-05-01   522
#> 6 1974-06-01   406
#> 7 1974-07-01   441
```

`ts_regular` can be used to make the value implicit:

```r
head(ts_regular(df))
#>         time value
#> 1 1974-01-01   901
#> 2 1974-02-01    NA
#> 3 1974-03-01   827
#> 4 1974-04-01   677
#> 5 1974-05-01   522
#> 6 1974-06-01   406
```

Regularization can be done for all frequencies that are suited for heuristic
conversion. In addition to these frequencies, the following higher frequencies
are detected and regularized as well:


| `ts`-frequency | time difference |
|----------------|-----------------|
|              1 | 1 sec           |
|              2 | 2 sec           |
|              5 | 5 sec           |
|             10 | 10 sec          |
|             15 | 15 sec          |
|             20 | 20 sec          |
|             30 | 30 sec          |
|             60 | 1 min           |
|            120 | 2 min           |
|            300 | 5 min           |
|            600 | 10 min          |
|            900 | 15 min          |
|           1200 | 20 min          |
|           1800 | 30 min          |
|           3600 | 1 hour          |
|           7200 | 2 hour          |
|          10800 | 3 hour          |
|          14400 | 4 hour          |
|          21600 | 6 hour          |
|          43200 | 12 hour         |
|          86400 | 1 day           |
