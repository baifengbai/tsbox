# Major Things

# - [ ] ts_bind, ts_c, binding POSIXct and Data should result in POSIXct, 
#       also should have the same var naming behavior)
# perhaps this can be done by letting ts_bind calling ts_c

# - [ ] unified handling of deparse(substitute(x))

# - heuristic = TURE to all conversion functions?
# - var.names = NULL
# var.names <- detect_var_names(var.names, deparse(substitute(x)))


# - [ ] reclassing of numeric, matrix output, similar to xts::reclass

    #' @export
    #' @rdname ts_
    # ts_scale <- ts_(function(x, ...){
    #   z <- scale.default(unclass(x), ...)
    #   xts::reclass(z, x)
    # }, class = "xts")

# - [ ] a cleaner ts_ function


# - [ ] Lookup table for heuristic frequency conversion


# - [ ] numeric vectors in ts_window()


# - [ ] Tools to enforce regularity (major and quite separate task)
