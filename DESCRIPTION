Description: Provides tools that are *agnostic* towards time series classes. 
  Built around a set of converters, which reliably convert time series stored as 
  "ts", "xts", "data.frame" or "data.table" to each other. Because this works, 
  we can define a set of tools that work the same way for each class. 
Imports: 
    data.table,
    anytime
Suggests: 
    testthat,
    dplyr,
    tibble,
    forecast,
    seasonal,
    dygraphs,
    xts,
